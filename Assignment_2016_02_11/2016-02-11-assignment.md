## 2E4  "The probability of water is 0.7" indicates that out of 10 times toss, the chance that you get the water side is 7 times. However, which side you get is not necessirily subjected to probability, instead, it is subjected to the gravity, the way you do the toss, whether there is wind when tossing, etc. 
## 2M3 Pr(earth|land) = Pr(land|earth)*Pr(earth)/Pr(land) = 0.3 * 0.5 / 130/200 = 0.23

## 2M4 I am getting a different answer. Based on my understanding, the probability of the side facing is black (Pr(B2)) given that its the other side is black (Pr(B1)) too can be written as Pr(B2|B1) = Pr(B1|B2) * Pr(B2) / Pr(B1) = 1/3 * 1/2 / 1/2 = 1/3.
