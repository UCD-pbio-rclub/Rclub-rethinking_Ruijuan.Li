# BRMS background
```{r}
# brms (Bayesian Regression Modelling using Stan) , an alternative to map2stan for interfacting with Stan
# brms has a more intuitive model specification and requires less data reformatting. 
# the author provides a very detailed description;also available by typing vignette("brms_overview") 
```

# installation
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("paul-buerkner/brms")
```

# model specification in brms, similar to lmer
```{r}
# repsonse ~ predictor1 + (1|random_predictor2) ... 
```

# use tomato dataset as example

# fit model hypoocytl length as function of treatment and species, and include a "random" effect for shelf.

            prior = set_prior("normal(0,10)",class="b") # I'll explain setting priors in the next section
) 

# note: 
# no dummy variable was created for trt, species, or shelf
# no priors was spcified for sigma and random effect
# the default number of chains is 4

# prior specification in brms 
```{r}
# brms will automatically set priors for many model parameters, but it uses non-sensical priors (uniform across all real numbers) for main-effect coefficients, so you must set priors for your main-effect coefficients. Most other priors have reasonable defaults.

# The function for setting priors is set_priors().
# 
# Priors in brms have different classes.
# 
# The "Intercept" class is for the overall intercept
# The "b" class is for coefficients on fixed effects (You can think of "b" as standing for "beta" coefficients)
# The "sigma" class is for the overall standard deviation. Defaults to student_t(3, 0, 10)
# The "sd" class is for the standard deviation of random effects terms. Defaults to student_t(3, 0, 10)
# If you want to give the same prior to all members of a class, then just name the class. In the example I gave above (repeated below) I am setting the priors for all beta coefficients in this case (trtL and the various species) to be normal(0,10).
