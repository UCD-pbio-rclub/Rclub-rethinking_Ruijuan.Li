# Liron's data
```{r}
### problem description 
# data sheet from Liron and records germination for M82 and pen at two temperatures.

# Perform a Bayesian analysis to determine whether or not the two species have different germination rates, whether temperature affects germination, and whether there is a temperature by germination interaction.  Determine the posterior estimates for germination rate for each species at each temperature and determine the confidence intervals around these estimates.

# A couple of hints: 
# 1) if you are using Stan you will need to remove the "." from any variable names.
# 2) You may want to baseline temperature so that the lowest value is 0 rather than 14
# 3) You may want to make a dummy variable for species.  Or alternatively use multiple intercepts.
