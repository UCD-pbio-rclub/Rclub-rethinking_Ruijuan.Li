```{r}
# 13E3 When is it possible for a varying slopes model to have fewer effective parameters (as estimated by WAIC or DIC) than the corresponding model with fixed (unpooled) slopes? Explain.

# ... 
```


```{r}
# 13M3. Re-estimate the varying slopes model for the UCBadmit data, now using a non-centered parameterization. Compare the efficiency of the forms of the model, using n_eff. Which is better? Which chain sampled faster?
