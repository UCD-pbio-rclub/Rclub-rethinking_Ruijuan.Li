write down a multiple regression to evaluate the claim: 
Animal diversity is linearly related to latitude, but only after contolling for plant diversity. 
(refer to counterfactual plot section?)
Da ~ a + BlL+BpDp
Da: animal diversity
a: intercept
Bl: coefficient that measures the association between latitude and animal diveristy
L: latitude
Bp: coefficient that measures the plant diversity between latitude and animal diveristy
Dp: plant diversity as a constant

significant SNP VS. population structure and traits 
significant SNPs are associated with traits and there is also spurious association between 
population structure and significant SNPs, but when population structure are corrected, the 
SNPs associated with population structure should mostly vanish.

"How might a high divorce rate cause a high marriage rate"? think of a way to evaluate this
relationship using multiple regression. (don't understand the question...)
M ~ a + BD + other factors 
M: marriage rate
a: intercept
B: association between marriage rate and divorce rate
other factors???

In the divorce data, state with high number of Mormons (LDS) have much lower divorce rate than 
the regression model expected. Find a list of LDS population by state and use those numbers as 
a predictor variable, predicting divorce rate using marriage rate, median age at marriage, and 
percent LDS population (possibly standardized). You may consider transformation of the raw 
percent LDS variable.
