2 & 4
3 is only one predictor, dosen't fit the definition of multiple linear regression: 
As a predictive analysis, the multiple linear regression is used to explain the relationship 
between one continuous depedent variable from two or more independent variables. 
```

## 5E2
```{}
write down a multiple regression to evaluate the claim: 
Animal diversity is linearly related to latitude, but only after contolling for plant diversity. 
(refer to counterfactual plot section?)
Da ~ a + BlL+BpDp
Da: animal diversity
a: intercept
Bl: coefficient that measures the association between latitude and animal diveristy
L: latitude
Bp: coefficient that measures the plant diversity between latitude and animal diveristy
Dp: plant diversity as a constant 
```

## 5M1
```{}
spurious significant SNP VS. population structure and phenotypic data 
spurious significant SNPs are associated with phenotypic data and population structure. 
But when population structure is entered in the model, the correlation between spurious significant 
SNPs and phenotypic data should mostly vanish. 
```

## 5M3
```{}
"How might a high divorce rate cause a high marriage rate"? think of a way to evaluate this
relationship using multiple regression. 
M ~ a + BD + other factors 
M: marriage rate
a: intercept
B: association between marriage rate and divorce rate
other factors???
first marriage or second marriage... 
```

## 5M4
```{}
In the divorce data, state with high number of Mormons (LDS) have much lower divorce rate than 
the regression model expected. Find a list of LDS population by state and use those numbers as 
a predictor variable, predicting divorce rate using marriage rate, median age at marriage, and 
percent LDS population (possibly standardized). You may consider transformation of the raw 
percent LDS variable. 
```

# transform the LDS data and standadization
d$percent.LDS.log10 <- log10(d$percent.LDS) # log10 transformation
d$percent.LDS.log10.s <- (d$percent.LDS.log10-mean(d$percent.LDS.log10))/sd(d$percent.LDS.log10) # log10 transformation & standardization

d$percent.LDS.s <- (d$percent.LDS-mean(d$percent.LDS))/sd(d$percent.LDS) # just standadization
# standadization marriage rate and median age marriage rate
